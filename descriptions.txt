<p>I'm a designer and developer, intrigued by modern innovations for interactivity and engagement. With a background in marketing, web development, and user experience, I'm always trying new tools to make creative projects stand out. Recently, that included augmented reality, 3D modeling/rendering, and generative AI.</p>

<p>Wicked is as much a lifestyle as it is a party wine. Wine is strongâ€”why not do more with it?</p>

<p>In tune with the hand-lettered type, the calligraphic icon is seductive, youthful, and artisanal. No rest for the Wicked.</p>

<p>The Alumni Networking Event is hosted annually by Lehigh F1RST, the university's first-generation club. For students whose parents did not attend college, the event offers a unique opportunity for first-gen students to connect with alumni of similar backgrounds over a catered dinner in business attire.</p>

<p>Areas of consideration for these marketing materials included the student-facing social media, alumni-facing outreach emails, and the physical materials for the event. Employing the preexisting club branding, I ensured all mediums were cohesive and corresponded with planned event decor such as balloons and tablecloths. I additionally established proper print guidelines for the brochures, which I personally designed, printed, and trimmed.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, I aimed to present the event as professional, elegant, and vibrant. This was fulfilling and exciting for me, and what the first-generation community of Lehigh deserves to experience!</p>

<p>If there's one thing parents agree about when it comes to their kids, it's that they get sick a lot. And like playing with their food. Clippies makes kiddos' lunchtime cleaner, fun, and more sustainable. Gone is single-use plastic and the hassle of cleaning reusable bags: enjoy the throwback of paper bagged lunch in snack form, secured by a Clippy! </p>

<p>In reimagining classic plastic snack bags, I chose the Clippies approach due to the various ways I could experiment with it. Drawing inspiration from training chopsticks and typical chip bag clips, I opted for an ergonomic design with minimal components.</p>

<p>"Prosaic" refers both to prose in written language and to something boring. With the goal of an infographic for a chosen word, I illustrated statistics on boredom and language-related things.</p>

<p>I envision this flyer hanging on a classroom wall, catching the eye of a bored student who reads that school is the top spot for boredom. I thought the flyer should have a silly and retro feel, and I wanted to debunk the common misconception that today's youth have lower attention spans and read less.</p>
